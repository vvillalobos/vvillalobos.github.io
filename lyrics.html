			<h3> Lyrics </h3>
			<p>What's been happening in your world? <br />
			What have you been up to? <br />
			I heard that you fell in love <br />
			Or near enough <br />
			I gotta tell you the truthâ€¦  </p>

			<p>I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby <br />
			Snap out of it (Snap out of it) <br />
			I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby <br />
			Snap out of it (Snap out of it) <br />
			If that watch don't continue to swing <br />
			Or the fat lady fancies having a sing <br />
			I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
			Snap out of it</p>

			<p>Forever isn't for everyone <br />
			Is forever for you? <br />
			It sounds like settling down or giving up <br />
			But it don't sound much like you girl  </p>

			<p>I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby <br />
			Snap out of it (Snap out of it) <br />
			I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby <br />
			Snap out of it (Snap out of it) <br />
			If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing <br />
			I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to <br />
			Snap out of it</p>

			<p>Under a spell you're hypnotized <br />
			Darling how could you be so blind? <br />
			(Snap out of it) <br />
			Under a spell you're hypnotized <br />
			Darling how could you be so blind?  </p>

			<p>I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby <br />
			Snap out of it (Snap out of it) <br />
			I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby <br />
			Snap out of it (Snap out of it) <br />
			If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing <br />
			I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to <br />
			Snap out of it  </p>
